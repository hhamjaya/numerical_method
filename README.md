# Numerical Method Lab

## Project Overview

This repository contains the lab report prepared by Team 5 for Numerical Method with Matlab course.

## Project Questions

### Question 1: Solving Non Linear Algebraic Equation

- **Proving there exist solution**: Use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to show that a continuous function changes sign, ensuring at least one root.
- **Applying Bisection Method**: Iteratively halves an interval where the function changes sign to approximate the root.
- **Applying Newton-Raphson Method**: Uses tangent line approximations to converge rapidly to a root starting from an initial guess.
- **Applying Secant Method**: Similar to Newton’s method but replaces the derivative with a finite difference approximation.

### Question 2: Numerical Integration

- **Applying Trapezoidal Rule**: Approximates the integral of a function by summing the areas of trapezoids under the curve.
- **Applying Simpson's Rule**: Uses quadratic polynomials to approximate the function and achieve higher accuracy in integration.

### Question 3: Curve Fitting

- **Applying the least squares exponential curve**: Fits an exponential function to data by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
- **Applying the Root-Mean-Square (RMS)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors between observed and predicted values in curve fitting.

### Question 4: Numerical Differentiation

- **Applying LU Factorization**: Decomposes a matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices to solve linear systems efficiently.
- **Applying BVP**: Solves differential equations with given conditions at multiple points using numerical methods.

### Question 5: Numerical Solution of Differential Equation

- **Applying ODE solver from Matlab**: Utilizes built-in MATLAB functions (e.g., ode45) to numerically solve ordinary differential equations.
- **Applying thethird-orderRunge-Kuttamethod(RK3)**: Uses a three-stage process to approximate the solution of differential equations with improved accuracy over Euler’s method.
